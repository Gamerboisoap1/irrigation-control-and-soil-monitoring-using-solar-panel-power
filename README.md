# irrigation-control-and-soil-monitoring-using-solar-panel-power

This project is aimed at developing an automated irrigation control system coupled with soil monitoring, powered by solar panels. It helps optimize water usage and ensure healthy plant growth by monitoring soil moisture levels and providing automated irrigation based on the data collected.

(this was an hackathon  problem statement )

# Overview
The frontend of the application is built using HTML and styled with CSS. It features a user sign-up form designed to collect information from users. 

## Features

- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Utilizes sensors to continuously measure soil moisture levels.
- **Automated Irrigation**: Based on the soil moisture data, the system automatically triggers irrigation when the soil becomes too dry.
- **Solar Panel Power**: The system is powered by solar panels, making it environmentally friendly and suitable for remote locations.
- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring soil conditions and system status.

# Components

- **Microcontroller**: Controls the overall system operation and interfaces with sensors and actuators.
- **Soil Moisture Sensors**: Measure the moisture content of the soil.
- **Water Pump**: Provides irrigation when triggered.
- **Solar Panels**: Generate power for the system.
- **SSD Screen**: Displays information to the user.
- **ESP8266**: Used for communication and connectivity.
- **LDR Sensor**: Measures ambient light levels.
- **DHT11**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **3 Volt Battery**: Powers specific components or acts as a backup power source.
- **TP Charging Module**: Charges the battery from the solar panel or other power sources.
- **Solar Charge Controller**: Manages the charging process from the solar panels to prevent overcharging and optimize power usage.









## Deployment


1. Clone the repository: 
https://github.com/Gamerboisoap1/irrigation-control-and-soil-monitoring-using-solar-panel-power

2. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries as mentioned in the documentation.

3. Connect the hardware components according to the provided schematic.

4. Upload the firmware to the microcontroller.

5. Configure any necessary settings such as Wi-Fi credentials or threshold values for soil moisture.
## Usage

1. Power on the system using the solar panels.

2. Access the user interface through a web browser or mobile app.

3. Monitor soil moisture levels and system status.

4. Adjust settings or manually trigger irrigation if needed.
